Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang. The game was created by
Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several
early test versions, it was released as a paid public alpha for personal
computers in 2009 before releasing in November 2011, with Jens Bergensten
taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other
platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with 200 million
copies sold and 126 million monthly active users as of 2020.
